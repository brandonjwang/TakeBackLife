<h1>Find your Focus.</h1>

<p>
  About a year ago, I broke down. I broke down because my grandmother passed away and I had been caring about things
  that I thought mattered the most. As it turns out, what I thought mattered and what actually mattered were different.
  As a result, I spent squandered the very previous time I could have had with my grandmother. I regret it to this day.

  A mentor of mine (Joe) gave me a framework on how to answer the difficult question "what matters"? I'm of the
  opinion that good questions are harder to find than good answers. This framework has been immensely helpful in my
  own life because it asks the right questions. Joe runs his own company and is a busy man. There's no way he can
  see everyone. But there's no reason why his frameworks can't help you so I wrote this app. I hope you find it helpful.
